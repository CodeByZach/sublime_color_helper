# ColorHelper

New release!

See `Preferences->Package Settings->ColorHelper->Changelog` for more info on  
prior releases.

A restart of Sublime Text is **strongly** encouraged.

Please report any issues as we _might_ have missed some required updates  
related to the upgrade to stable `coloraide`.

## 6.2.0

- **NEW**: Upgrade ColorAide to 2.0.1.
- **FIX**: Fix regression where contrast logic could not adjust to a  
  given contrast due to a property access.
